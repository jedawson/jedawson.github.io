title: MTA Turnstile Data. Project 1
---

## Intro
For the MTA Turnstile Data Project 1, the project's directive was to increase the number of signups for the Women Tech Women Yes.

### Overview
There are multiple ways to approach this assignment. Since the main goal of the client is to engage people from the tech industry, the best possible way to target the tech industry is at the stations closest to their workplace.

### Data Gathering
Initially, the data from the MTA turnstiles were going to be an important part of the assignment.
However, we saw that the best data would come from other sources. These other sources include the location in latitude and longitude form and the list of top tech companies.
We were able to locate specific location data based on the MTA's specific codes from Chris Whong's dataset. Here is the blog post from him that led us to his github with the data of the turnstiles' locations: https://chriswhong.com/open-data/visualizing-the-mtas-turnstile-data/.
I also wrote the code to gather data from the made in nyc's blog post about the top local 100 tech companies: https://www.builtinnyc.com/2017/11/07/nyc-top-100-tech-companies-2017. Each companies' address was on a different link, so the crawler went to those links to extract the address. The list they wrote does not include companies that have their headquarters in different cities. This slice of data doesn't give a complete picture of the tech scene in NYC, but their list is a good enough approximation. The data from the built in nyc's website did not provide addresses for every single company, so we used google to find the address of the companies with missing or vague addresses.
